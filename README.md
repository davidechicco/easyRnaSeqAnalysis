`easyRnaSeqAnalysis`: an easy method to prepare RNA-Seq data for any analysis

## Summary ##

Bioinformatics analysis of RNA-Seq data is often limited by the necessity of having multiple preprocessing steps applied to the RNA-Seq data before running the actual scientific analysis. 
The goal of this `R` package is to make all these steps easy and possibly automated, in order to prepare the data for the scientific analysis without much effort.
Optimistically, the user will have to indicate the GEO accession code of the RNA-Seq dataset she/he wants to preprocess and few other input parameters, and this package will perform all the preprocessing steps in order to make the dataset available for any analyses.



## Contacts ##

The `easyRnaSeqAnalysis` package will be developed by [Davide Chicco](http://www.DavideChicco.it). Questions should be
addressed to davidechicco(AT)davidechicco.it
